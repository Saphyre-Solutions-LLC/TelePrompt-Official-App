## üåü **Key Features of TelePrompt**

### **1. AI-Powered Real-Time Assistance**
TelePrompt leverages **semantic search** and **vector-based embeddings** to deliver highly accurate and context-aware responses. By analyzing the documents you upload, TelePrompt can generate **verbatim responses** that mirror your personality, skills, and experiences. It‚Äôs like having a professional assistant in your corner at all times.

### **2. Seamless Integration with Google Speech-to-Text API**
To get started with TelePrompt, you need to create a **JSON API key** from the [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). This key will enable TelePrompt to transcribe and process audio for real-time spoken responses.

- **Step 1:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **Step 2:** Create a project and enable the **Speech-to-Text API** in Google Cloud.
- **Step 3:** Create an **API Key** (make sure you are using the **free tier**, which will never cost you any money).
- **Step 4:** Download the **JSON API Key** file from the Google Cloud Console.
- **Step 5:** Place the downloaded **JSON key file** in the root directory of your **TelePrompt** project folder. This will allow TelePrompt to access Google's Speech-to-Text capabilities for transcribing audio in real-time.

You‚Äôll also need to configure **Google AI Studio** for generating responses with the Google Gemini API. You can follow these steps to get your Google AI API key:

- **Step 1:** Visit [Google AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/ai) and select **Get API**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **free tier** to ensure that you won‚Äôt be charged.
- **Step 3:** Save the **API key** provided by Google.
- **Step 4:** Open the **`ai_interface.py`** file in your project directory and replace the placeholder for the API key with your actual **Google AI API key**.

With both the **Google Speech-to-Text JSON Key** and **Google AI Studio API Key**, you're now ready to leverage the full power of TelePrompt.
